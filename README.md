## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Object-oriented programming
  - Class
  - Constructor
  - Object

### What I learned

By developing this project, I could put into practice so many different concepts and methods that JavaScript has to offer, such as the array methods, JavaScript Classes and objects, and even a little bit of Regular Expressions.

### Continued development

Although I could use Regular Expression on this project, that is a concept I am still not completely comfortable with and I need to study it further.

Now that I could see the usability of object-oriented programming and how it helps a lot with organizing code for maximum reusability I plan to carry on applying this approach to future projects.
